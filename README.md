INTERN ID: CT12QYV

DURATION: 8 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHU

DESCRIPTION:
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has transformed the landscape of data science by enabling the development of highly accurate models that can automatically learn complex patterns from large datasets. A deep learning project typically involves designing and training artificial neural networks to solve tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, recommendation systems, or time series forecasting. Below is an overview of a deep learning project lifecycle in the context of data science.

Project Overview: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
One common deep learning project in data science is image classification using CNNs. For example, consider building a model to automatically classify images of different types of fruits (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges) based on photographs.

Conclusion
This deep learning project demonstrates how data science and AI can be applied to real-world image classification problems. Through data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment, deep learning enables the automation of tasks that once required human expertise. With continued advancements, deep learning is expected to power even more intelligent applications across industries.
